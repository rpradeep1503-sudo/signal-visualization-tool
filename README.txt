# Signal Visualization & Analysis Tool

## Overview
This project is a Python-based interactive tool designed to visualize fundamental signals used in Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE).

It helps students understand signal behavior practically instead of only through equations.

## Features
- Generate Sine, Square, and Triangular signals
- Adjustable amplitude and frequency using sliders
- Interactive graphical user interface (GUI)
- Automatic saving of signal plots
- Time-domain signal visualization

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Tkinter (GUI)

## How It Works
1. User selects signal type
2. Adjusts amplitude and frequency
3. Clicks "Plot Signal"
4. Signal is displayed and saved automatically
